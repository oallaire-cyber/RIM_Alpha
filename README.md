## 📋 Overview

The Risk Influence Map (RIM) is an innovative methodology for visualizing and managing the complex relationships between risks in large-scale programs. It distinguishes between:

- **Strategic Risks**: Consequence-oriented risks managed by program leadership
- **Operational Risks**: Cause-oriented risks managed by functional teams
- **Top Program Objectives (TPOs)**: Key program goals that risks may impact

## ✨ Features

### Risk Management
- Two-level risk architecture (Strategic/Operational)
- Multi-category classification (Programme, Produit, Industriel, Supply Chain)
- Contingent risk support with activation conditions and decision dates
- Probability × Impact exposure calculation

### Influence Mapping
- Three types of influence links:
  - **Level 1**: Operational → Strategic (red)
  - **Level 2**: Strategic → Strategic (purple)
  - **Level 3**: Operational → Operational (blue)
- Configurable strength (Weak/Moderate/Strong/Critical)
- Confidence scoring

### Top Program Objectives (TPOs)
- Link strategic risks to program objectives
- Cluster-based organization (Product Efficiency, Business Efficiency, Industrial Efficiency, Sustainability, Safety)
- Impact level tracking (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- Yellow hexagon visualization

### Visualization
- Interactive graph powered by PyVis
- Color coding by level or exposure
- **Fullscreen mode** for detailed graph exploration (press F or click button)
- Multiple layout algorithms:
  - Layered (TPO → Strategic → Operational)
  - Category-based (2×2 grid)
  - TPO Cluster grouping
  - **Auto-spread layout** with size-aware node spacing
- Manual layout save/load with position capture
- Physics toggle for node arrangement
- Draggable nodes when physics is disabled

### 📊 Edge Visibility Control (New)
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show only the most important edges
- **Slider control**: Adjust from 0% to 100% of edges displayed
- **Smart ranking**: Edges ranked by strength × confidence
- **Reduces clutter**: Makes complex graphs more readable

### 🔍 Influence Explorer
- **Select any node** to explore its influence network
- **Direction control**: 
  - Upstream (what influences this node)
  - Downstream (what this node influences)
  - Both directions
- **Depth control**: Limit traversal depth (1-10 levels) or unlimited
- **Level filter**: Show All / Strategic only / Operational only
- **TPO inclusion**: Toggle to show impacted TPOs
- **Visual highlighting**: Selected node highlighted with red border and ★ symbol
- **Network statistics**: Count of risks, TPOs, and connections displayed

### 📊 Influence Analysis Panel (New)
A comprehensive analysis toolkit to identify key risks for mitigation:

#### 🎯 Top Propagators
- Identifies risks with **highest downstream impact**
- Shows propagation score, TPOs reached, and risks influenced
- **Use case**: "Mitigate here for global effect"
- Click 🔍 to explore the node in the graph

#### ⚠️ Convergence Points
- Identifies risks/TPOs where **multiple influences converge**
- Shows influence score, source count, and path count
- Flags "High convergence" nodes requiring transverse management
- **Use case**: "Mitigate upstream rather than directly"

#### 🔥 Critical Paths
- Shows **strongest influence chains** from Operational risks to TPOs
- Displays full path with visual icons (🔵→🟣→🟡)
- Shows path strength score
- **Use case**: Identify key risk propagation routes

#### 🚧 Bottlenecks
- Identifies nodes appearing in **many paths to TPOs**
- Shows path count and percentage of total paths
- Flags critical bottlenecks (>50%)
- **Use case**: "Single points of failure"

#### 📦 Risk Clusters
- Identifies **tightly interconnected risk groups**
- Shows size, level breakdown, internal links, and density
- Lists included risks
- **Use case**: "Consider managing as units"

### Filter System
- Quick filter presets (Full View, Strategic Focus, Operational Focus, etc.)
- Multi-select filters with All/None buttons
- Filter validation and summary display
- Persistent filter state

### Import/Export
- Excel import/export with detailed logging

## 📈 Analysis Algorithms

### Propagation Score
Measures downstream impact using weighted reachability:
- TPO reached: 10 points × impact level
- Strategic risk reached: 5 points
- Operational risk reached: 2 points
- Decay factor: 0.85^depth (closer = more impact)

### Convergence Score
Measures upstream influence concentration:
- Counts unique source risks and paths
- Weights by source type (Operational = 1.0, Strategic = 0.7)
- Bonus multiplier for multiple independent paths
- Flags high convergence when paths > sources × 1.5

### Bottleneck Detection
Identifies single points of failure:
- Counts appearances in all paths to TPOs
- Calculates percentage of total paths
- Critical threshold: >50%

### Cluster Detection
Finds tightly interconnected groups:
- Uses connected component analysis
- Calculates density (internal edges / possible edges)
- Groups by primary category
