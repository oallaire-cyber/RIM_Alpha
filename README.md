## 📋 Overview

The Risk Influence Map (RIM) is an innovative methodology for visualizing and managing the complex relationships between risks in large-scale programs. It distinguishes between:

- **Strategic Risks**: Consequence-oriented risks managed by program leadership
- **Operational Risks**: Cause-oriented risks managed by functional teams
- **Top Program Objectives (TPOs)**: Key program goals that risks may impact

## ✨ Features

### Risk Management
- Two-level risk architecture (Strategic/Operational)
- Multi-category classification (Programme, Produit, Industriel, Supply Chain)
- Contingent risk support with activation conditions and decision dates
- Probability × Impact exposure calculation

### Influence Mapping
- Three types of influence links:
  - **Level 1**: Operational → Strategic (red)
  - **Level 2**: Strategic → Strategic (purple)
  - **Level 3**: Operational → Operational (blue)
- Configurable strength (Weak/Moderate/Strong/Critical)
- Confidence scoring

### Top Program Objectives (TPOs)
- Link strategic risks to program objectives
- Cluster-based organization (Product Efficiency, Business Efficiency, Industrial Efficiency, Sustainability, Safety)
- Impact level tracking (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- Yellow hexagon visualization

### Visualization
- Interactive graph powered by PyVis
- Color coding by level or exposure
- **Fullscreen mode** for detailed graph exploration (press F or click button)
- Multiple layout algorithms:
  - Layered (TPO → Strategic → Operational)
  - Category-based (2×2 grid)
  - TPO Cluster grouping
  - **Auto-spread layout** with size-aware node spacing
- Manual layout save/load with position capture
- Physics toggle for node arrangement
- Draggable nodes when physics is disabled

### 🔍 Influence Explorer (New)
- **Select any node** to explore its influence network
- **Direction control**: 
  - Upstream (what influences this node)
  - Downstream (what this node influences)
  - Both directions
- **Depth control**: Limit traversal depth (1-10 levels) or unlimited
- **Level filter**: Show All / Strategic only / Operational only
- **TPO inclusion**: Toggle to show impacted TPOs
- **Visual highlighting**: Selected node highlighted with red border and ★ symbol
- **Network statistics**: Count of risks, TPOs, and connections displayed

### Filter System
- Quick filter presets (Full View, Strategic Focus, Operational Focus, etc.)
- Multi-select filters with All/None buttons
- Filter validation and summary display
- Persistent filter state

### Import/Export
- Excel import/export with detailed logging
- Name-based relationship matching for re-import capability
- Comprehensive error reporting and warnings
- Cypher templates for bulk database operations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher

- Git (for cloning)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oallaire-cyber/RIM_Alpha
   cd rim-alpha
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up Neo4j**
   - Install [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download/) or use [Neo4j Aura](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/) (cloud)
   - Create a new database
   - Note your connection URI, username, and password

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_alpha.py
   ```

6. **Connect to Neo4j**
   - Enter your Neo4j credentials in the sidebar
   - Click "Connect"

## 🎮 Usage

### Creating Risks

1. Navigate to the **🎯 Risks** tab
2. Fill in the risk details:
   - Name (required)
   - Level: Strategic or Operational
   - Categories (multi-select)
   - Description
   - Status: Active, Contingent, or Archived
   - Probability and Impact (for exposure calculation)
3. Click "Create Risk"

### Creating Influences

1. Navigate to the **🔗 Influences** tab
2. Select source and target risks
3. Configure strength and confidence
4. Add description
5. Click "Create Influence"

### Creating TPOs

1. Navigate to the **🏆 TPOs** tab
2. Enter reference code (e.g., TPO-01)
3. Select cluster category
4. Add name and description
5. Click "Create TPO"

### Linking Risks to TPOs

1. Navigate to the **📌 TPO Impacts** tab
2. Select a strategic risk and a TPO
3. Set impact level
4. Click "Create Impact"

### Using the Influence Explorer

1. In the **📊 Visualization** tab, enable "🔍 Enable Influence Explorer"
