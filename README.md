## 📋 Overview

The Risk Influence Map (RIM) is an innovative methodology for visualizing and managing the complex relationships between risks in large-scale programs. It transforms static risk registers into dynamic risk intelligence by distinguishing between:

- **Strategic Risks**: Consequence-oriented risks managed by program leadership
- **Operational Risks**: Cause-oriented risks managed by functional teams
- **Top Program Objectives (TPOs)**: Key program goals that risks may impact
- **Mitigations**: Actions and controls that address identified risks

## ✨ Features

### Risk Management
- Two-level risk architecture (Strategic/Operational)
- Multi-category classification (Programme, Produit, Industriel, Supply Chain)
- **Risk Origin tracking** (New vs Legacy):
  - **New**: Program-specific risks identified and managed within the program
  - **Legacy**: Inherited risks from other programs or Enterprise-level risk registers
- Contingent risk support with activation conditions and decision dates
- Probability × Impact exposure calculation

### Influence Mapping
- Three types of influence links:
  - **Level 1**: Operational → Strategic (red)
  - **Level 2**: Strategic → Strategic (purple)
  - **Level 3**: Operational → Operational (blue)
- Configurable strength (Weak/Moderate/Strong/Critical)
- Confidence scoring

### Top Program Objectives (TPOs)
- Link strategic risks to program objectives
- Cluster-based organization (Product Efficiency, Business Efficiency, Industrial Efficiency, Sustainability, Safety)
- Impact level tracking (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- Yellow hexagon visualization

### Mitigation Management
- **Mitigation Types**:
  - **Dedicated**: Program-owned mitigations created specifically for identified risks
  - **Inherited**: Mitigations inherited from other entities or programs
  - **Baseline**: Standard controls from requirements, regulations, or industry standards
- **Mitigation Status tracking**: Proposed, In Progress, Implemented, Deferred
- **Effectiveness scoring**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Many-to-many relationships**: One mitigation can address multiple risks
- Source entity tracking for inherited/baseline mitigations
- Green rectangle visualization with dashed edges to risks

### Visualization
- Interactive graph powered by PyVis
- Color coding by level or exposure
- **Visual distinction for risk origins**:
  - New risks: Standard border
  - Legacy risks: Gray dashed border with [L] prefix
- **Mitigation visualization**:
  - Green rectangles (color varies by type)
  - Dashed green edges showing mitigation relationships

### Migration for Existing Data

If you have existing risks without the `origin` property, run this Cypher query to set a default:

```cypher
MATCH (r:Risk)
WHERE r.origin IS NULL
SET r.origin = 'New'
RETURN count(r) as updated_risks
```

**Best Practices:**
- Prioritize mitigating risks flagged as "High Priority" first
- Ensure all Strategic risks have at least one implemented mitigation
- Monitor category coverage to identify systematic gaps
- Use the "Visualize in Graph" feature to understand risk context before deciding on mitigation approach
